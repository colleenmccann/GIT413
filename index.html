                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Colleen McCann. Ced is a nickname that just really stuck. I'm 23 years old, and I'm graduating from Arizona State University in May. 
                    My major is Graphic Information Technology with a primary focus in Web Design &amp; Development and a secondary focus in Computer Systems. (It's a mouthful.) 
                    I attended Illinois Institute of Technology for two years before taking a gap year, then I transferred to ASU. I'm currently living in Texas, but I was born and raised near Chicago.
                    I have a lovely 9 year old husky named Katara, and she's the laziest dog I've ever met. Most of my free time is spent playing video games with friends,
                    but I can also be caught drawing digitally, reading fantasy books, or working out.
                </p>

                    <h4>Portfolio Website (Personal)</h4>
                    <p>I needed a place to display my workâ€¦so I made one. There's no better way to
                        showcase web development skills than through an original, fully functional website.
                        The website itself is still under construction, and you may notice that it looks a lot like this one!
                        The site aims to not only direct users to view past projects but also to be its own work.
                        Clean, concise HTML and CSS work best to create a clean, concise site. A simple
                        design for a simple purpose.</p>

                    <h4>Something for Everyone (GIT230)</h4>
                    <p>This was an early student work for a design course I took before deciding to take the
                        web development route in my degree. Nintendo often focuses on being a family-friendly video game
                        company, but that can alienate people who play more mature video games. This
                        advertisement features several different games of different genres and ESRB ratings (E
                        for Everyone, E10+ for Everyone aged 10 and up, T for Teen, and M for Mature) to
                        convey the message that every gamer has something to play on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

                    <h4>Claire Sinagra (GIT450)</h4>
                    <p>Claire Sinagra needed a responsive web design to fit several different device sizes. A
                        mobile-first approach to web design and development allows for better search engine
                        optimization as well as a more user-friendly experience. Users on any device will have
                        an easy time navigating through different areas of the site-media queries are used so
                        that the site will adapt to a mobile, tablet, or desktop design based on the user's
                        method of access.</p>

                    <a href="succulent-site/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="succulent-site/preview.png" alt="student succulent-themed website preview"></a>
                    <h4>Ced's Succulents (GIT417)</h4>
                    <p>This is a website focused on showcasing different functions of JavaScript. It's themed
                        around my favorite types of succulents. JavaScript features are shown with event
                        listeners for a dark mode toggle button, a random number match game, and a carousel
                        menu with different types of succulents shown. This was one of my favorite projects so
                        far because I was given a lot of creative freedom! I had lots of fun choosing the color
                        scheme and tone of the site.</p>

                <section class="work-list" id="work5">
                    <a href="seniorproject-site/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="seniorproject-site/preview.png" alt="senior project calculus website preview"></a>
                    <h4>Calculus Kept Simple (Senior Project)</h4>
                    <p>A lot of students struggle with calculus, which gets very complex very quickly.
                        Confusion with complex concepts in calculus often stems from a lack of proper
                        understanding of fundamental concepts, but a lot of math tutorials overcomplicate
                        things, causing frustration. This site breaks numbers down into words, but keeps
                        explanations concise. It's a tried-and-true method I used for years when tutoring my
                        friends in calculus. The site itself is responsive, supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop
                        layouts, and is multi-page.</p>

                <section class="work-list" id="work6">
                    <a href="lofi-site/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="lofi-site/preview.png" alt="student lo-fi song website preview"></a>
                    <h4>lo-fi | life's bgm (GIT337)</h4>
                    <p>A one-page concept site meant as practice with HTML and CSS&mdash;but it features a
                        working music player (media embed) with my favorite lo-fi song! Muted colors fit right
                        in with the calming tone that lo-fi creates. I'd like to revisit this sometime by either
                        incorporating its themes into a future website design or finishing the page as a
                        personal project. The site is partially responsive, having only one layout but adjusting
                        sizes of images and spacing based on the browser size.</p>

                    <h4>Future Project: A NEW Portfolio Website</h4>
                    <p>The website I'm currently working on is very simple, but not in all the best ways. A web
                        developer needs to show as many skills as possible in a website under their name, and
                        mine currently only displays mastery of basic HTML and CSS skills. It would be best to
                        have a website that showcases all of the skills I currently have, which would include
                        JavaScript and more complex HTML and CSS. I'm still learning more JavaScript, and this project
                        will begin once my knowledge has solidified.</p>
